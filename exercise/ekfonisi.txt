Develop an app for counting the score of a basketball game. 
The UI of the app should be similar to the following one. 

In particular:
You should definitely implement the specific "red lines" shown below, 
i.e. you should make sure that your app adheres to the particular whitespace "dp" values shown below. 
  
Don't worry about having or not the three dots at the top right.
You should take advantage of what we learned in the 2nd lecture, in terms of styles and themes, 
i.e. you should make use of styles and themes in your app. It is Ok if you choose different 
primary/secondary colors based on your own preferences. 

It is Ok, if you add a background image, or make other stylistic changes to the app.

You should localize the app for the Greek language in addition to the default english one.
